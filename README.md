https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-fast-food
	Dataset with lists of fast food restaurants with their name, location, and a category.
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-public-art 
	Dataset with the title of the art, artist, location(neighborhood) and other info.
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-plumbers 
	Dataset with plumbers registration number, first and last name and zip code.
Group made ZiptoNeighbor dataset
	Translates the neighborhoods to correlating zipcodes to make the datasets more useable.
Overall we found our best neighborhood with these datasets to by finding which had the conveniece of food, beauty of art and then for the real life situations- access to a plumber.
We felt like these metircs helped give an overall feel to a neighborhood having everything and not just having something of one neighborhood.
